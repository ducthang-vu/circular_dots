# CIRCULAR_DOTS
CIRCULAR_DOTS is a simple and interactive canvas built with HTML, CSS, and (vanilla) JavaScript.

 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ <img src="img/preview.png" width= "700px">

## Feature
On page load, 50 dots will be spawned. They will be moving in circular motion with an angular velocity of 0.05 radiants. The center of rotation is the same for all dots.

A light trail is left on the canvas by the dots.

Move the mouse inside the page: the center of rotation will follow the cursor.
